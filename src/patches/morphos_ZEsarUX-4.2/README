This patch enables ZEsarUX 4.2 to compile on MorphOS operating system. 
It disables text-to-speech functions because MorphOS doesn have fork function and I haven't found a substitute yet.
It has been created by Javier R. Santurde (tolkien)

To apply it:

cd (where the ZEsarUX 4.2 source code is)
patch -p2 < route_to_patch.txt

Then follow the usual compilation process
